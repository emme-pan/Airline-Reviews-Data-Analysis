As someone who flies atleast twice a year, I never really put much thought into which airline to pick. I was more concerned with finding the most cost-effective airplane tickets and only saw flights as a means of travel to get to where I was staying. 
As such, I am unaware of the opinions that people had about the various airline companies. This project aims to develop my data scraping and analysis skills while also keeping me up to date about the services that people consider when choosing an airline company 
to fly with. 


## Introduction
This project scrapes the data containing the reviews and ratings of airlines from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/) and performs various data analysis.
The code within the repository contains two parts: the first is used to data scrape the reviews from the site and creates a useable .csv table whereas the second is the main report, which includes data visualization and predictive modelling. 

This project is currently an ongoing process.
For the time being, everything is done in Python via Jupyter Notebook. However, once the main components are complete, I would like to extend my work into analysing the data using other statistical programming languages such as SQL, SAS, and R, as well as commonly used 
data visualization software in the industry, such as Power BI and Tableau.

I decided to use Air Canada as my airline of interest because it was the largest airline in Canada and had more reviews compared to other airlines. Having a larger dataset is important for analysis since the larger a sample set is, 
the more accurate results are. It provides a better representation of the population's opinion of the company and has a smaller margin of error. 

## Objective
From a business perspective, this report helps the airline of interest to analyze the public opinion concerning their company. It also helps them evaluate which services to focus on, through visualization and statistical analysis. Because of how much analysis
could be performed with the dataset, some business questions may not be covered in the report and may require further testing. 

An example question that may be clear only after analysis could be which services are the most included in reviews, signalling that that service is more valued or used compared to the rest. For example, WiFi usage is less likely to be used by customers as it is an
additional cost and therefore there may be only a few reviews that provide a rating for that compared to Seat Comfort, which is more likely to be experienced, and thus, more likely to be included in the reviews.

The completion of this project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in data scraping, data transformation, exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, and data visualization techniques, showcasing strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
